# Probability-of-Obtuse-Triangle
This will contain files of the probability of getting an obtuse triangle.

The file "triangle.m" contains only one interation of the loop which outputs the three random coordinates along with the distnace between each side. Along with what theta is from the law of cosine.

The file "multiTriangle.m" contains an interation of "triangle.m" 10,000 times. If the triangle is obtuse (the theta is greater than 90 degrees) than it would be added to a counter. Then after the loop the result is deisplayed which is the counter divided by the number of iterations.
